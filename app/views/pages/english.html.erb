      <h2>What is AdLit?</h2>
      <p>AdLit  is a four-year interdisciplinary research project, financed by the IWT (Belgian agency for innovation by science and technology).

      <p>The main goal of the AdLit project is to investigate how we can empower children and youth to cope with advertising, so that they can grow up to be critical, informed consumers who make their own conscious choices in today’s new media environment.</p>
