      <h2>What is AdLit?</h2>
      <p>AdLit  is a four-year interdisciplinary research project, financed by the IWT (Belgian agency for innovation by science and technology). AdLit is short for advertising literacy, which refers to the personal knowledge people have about advertising, its  persuasive intent, and the advertising techniques that are used to target them.</p>

      <p>The main goal of the AdLit project is to investigate how we can empower children and youth to cope with advertising, so that they can grow up to be critical, informed consumers who make their own conscious choices in today’s new media environment.</p>
